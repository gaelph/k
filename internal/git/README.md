## Directory listings for zsh with git features

**k** makes directory listings more readable, adding a bit of color and some git status information on files and directories.

### Git status on entire repos

### Git status on files within a working tree

### File weight colours

Files sizes are graded from green for small (< 1k), to red for huge (> 1mb).

**Human readable files sizes**  
Human readable files sizes can be shown by using the `-H` flag, which requires the `numfmt` command to be available. OS X / Darwin does not have a `numfmt` command by default, so GNU coreutils needs to be installed, which provides `gnumfmt` that `k` will also use if available. GNU coreutils can be installed on OS X with [homebrew](http://brew.sh):

```
brew install coreutils
```
